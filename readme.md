# ProgramADroid - MIT4 - Cross-platform App Development

ProgramADroid is an app developed for the course Cross-platform App Development at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences.

The goal was to create an app in which users can learn programming by playing a game and that's what we have created.

Here is a video showing what the app looks like, and what it does: [ProgramADroid](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AsMmKz2KeOZ0RUYVJnOUJtRzg)
